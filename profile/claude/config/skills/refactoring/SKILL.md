name: refactoring
description: Guide for restructuring code without changing observable behavior, based on Martin Fowler's Refactoring. Use this skill whenever the user asks to refactor, clean up, improve, simplify, or restructure code — even if they don't use the word "refactoring" explicitly. Also trigger when the user asks why code feels wrong, mentions code smells (long functions, duplicate code, God classes, feature envy, etc.), wants to extract a function or class, needs to rename things for clarity, asks how to reduce coupling or improve cohesion, or wants to apply patterns like Replace Conditional with Polymorphism or Introduce Parameter Object.

# Refactoring

Refactoring is a change to the internal structure of software that makes it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.

## Refactoring Rhythm

- Work in small steps.
- Run tests before each step so you know the current behavior.
- Run tests after each step so every micro-change stays behavior-preserving.
- If a step feels risky, make the step smaller.

## How to Navigate

1. Identify the smell that best matches the code you are reading.
2. Open the corresponding smell reference to understand the pressure it creates.
3. Follow the linked techniques that match the shape of the problem.
4. Apply one small refactoring at a time, running tests before and after each step.
